     <img src="images/tools_views/WordEntry.png" alt="On-screen keyboard with word suggestions" width="300"/>
</div>

#### Entropy Methods for Final Word Calculation

**ü™ô Coin Flip Entropy Method**
- Flip a physical coin exactly 7 times
- For each flip, select **1 for Heads** or **0 for Tails**
- The system displays your binary string and calculates the checksum
- This provides additional randomness for the final word selection

<div align="center">
     <img src="images/tools_views/ToolsCalcFinalWordCoinFlipsView.png" alt="Coin flip entropy interface" width="300"/>
</div>

**üìù Word Selection Entropy Method**
- Choose any word from the BIP39 wordlist as your entropy source
- The system calculates the final word using the selected word's 11-bit binary value plus the required 4-bit checksum

**üî¢ Finalize with Zeros Method**
- Uses a simple 7-bit string of zeros plus the calculated 4-bit checksum
- This is the quickest method but provides no additional entropy

<div align="center">
     <img src="images/tools_views/ToolsCalcFinalWordShowFinalWordView_coin_flips.png" alt="Final word calculation screen" width="300"/>
</div>

> **üìö Technical Note**: The final word in any BIP39 seed contains both entropy bits and checksum bits. The checksum ensures the seed phrase is mathematically valid and helps detect transcription errors.

## üîê Security Considerations

### Air-Gapped Security
SeedSigner is designed to be completely air-gapped for maximum security:
- **No Network Connections**: Never connects to WiFi, Bluetooth, or internet
- **QR Code Communication**: All data transfer via visual QR codes only
- **Temporary Memory**: All sensitive data cleared when power is removed
- **Open Source**: Code is publicly auditable for security verification

### Threat Model Protection
SeedSigner protects against:
- **Malware on computers** - Private keys never touch connected devices
- **Network attacks** - No network connectivity means no remote attacks
- **Supply chain attacks** - Open source hardware and software
- **Physical tampering** - Stateless design prevents persistent backdoors

### Limitations to Understand
- **Physical security required** - Device must be physically secured
- **User verification critical** - You must verify all transaction details
- **Backup security essential** - Seed phrase backup security is your responsibility
- **Single points of failure** - Losing seed phrase means losing Bitcoin access
