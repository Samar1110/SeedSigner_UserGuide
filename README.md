The WaveShare LCD Hat provides the following controls:

- **Joystick**: Four-directional navigation (Up, Down, Left, Right) plus center press
- **Key1 (A)**: Primary action button
- **Key2 (B)**: Secondary action button  
- **Key3 (C)**: Tertiary action button

### Button Functions Reference

| Control        | Function                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Joystick Up    | Move selection up                           |
| Joystick Down  | Move selection down                         |
| Joystick Left  | Move selection left                         |
| Joystick Right | Move selection right                        |
| Joystick Press | Alternative selection/confirm (context-dependent) |
| Key1 (A)       | Select highlighted option or confirm action |
| Key2 (B)       | Select highlighted option or confirm action |
| Key3 (C)       | Select highlighted option or confirm action |

**Important Navigation Notes**:

- All three keys (A, B, C) function identically for selection and confirmation
